# Cool String Printer

This is a simple GUI application built with Python's `tkinter` library that creates a "cool print" effect for the text entered by the user. As you type in a string and press the "Magic" button (or hit Enter), the application displays the characters in a visually engaging manner.

## Features

- Input field to enter any string.
- Displays the string character by character with a typing effect.
- Supports spaces in the input.
- Responsive UI that does not freeze during the printing process.

## Requirements

To run this application, you need to have Python installed on your system. This project uses the following libraries:

- `tkinter`: This library is included with Python's standard library. No additional installation is necessary.
- `threading`: Also included with Python's standard library.

## Installation

Clone the repository to your local machine using:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cool-string-printer.git
```

## Usage

1. Enter a string in the input field.
2. Click the "Magic" button or press Enter to see the string printed with the cool effect.
3. The string will appear one character at a time, creating a typing animation.
